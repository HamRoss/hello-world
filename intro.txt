Hello, my name is Ross. I live in Stockport and I have a wonderful fiancee and a chihuahua. 

For a long time I worked as a copywriter, but now I'm starting a new career as a coder.  

Some ambitions I hope to realise throgh coding are: 

1. Make software to help small businesses [fuck starbucks] 	☕
2. Travel 	🌅
3. Make some new friends 😄
4. Not worry about money 🙂
5. Buy a cabin retreat in the middle of nowhere ⛺

I hope I'll get there soon. 

Test edit of file. 

Test edit with new branch

Ok now this branch is really different from main.

This line is me making an edit locally on my computer. I cloned the hello-world repository in Terminal and opened it on my computer. I'm now making this edit, before I commit the changes and push it back up to GitHub.
