Hello, my name is Ross. I live in Stockport and I have a wonderful fiancee and a chihuahua. 

For a long time I worked as a copywriter, but now I'm starting a new career as a coder.  

Some ambitions I hope to realise throgh coding are: 

1. Make software to help small businesses [fuck starbucks]
2. Travel
3. Make some new friends
4. Not worry about money
5. Buy a cabin retreat in the middle of nowhere

I hope I'll get there soon.
