Hello, my name is Ross. I live in Stockport and I have a wonderful fiancee and a chihuahua. 

For a long time I worked as a copywriter, but now I'm starting a new career as a coder.  

Some ambitions I hope to realise throgh coding are: 

1. Make software to help small businesses [fuck starbucks] 	:coffee:
2. Travel 	:sunrise:
3. Make some new friends :smile:
4. Not worry about money :slightly_smiling_face:	
5. Buy a cabin retreat in the middle of nowhere :tent:

I hope I'll get there soon. 

Test edit of file. 

Test edit with new branch

Ok now this branch is really different from main.
